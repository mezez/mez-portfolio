A lot of developers build amazing tools everyday but somehow struggle o come up with a portfolio site for themselves. I happen to be the biggest culprit of this. This tool is a generic one that should lift the burden of having to build portfolio sites for themselves.

To set up, all you have to do is modify the config.js file in the components folder to suit your profile.

Project is only just starting and open to contributions.

Currently having difficulties intregrating UI elements from https://github.com/contiamo/operational-ui, a great tool for making usage of UI elemets really easy and amazing.
